ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Talent Recruiter from integrify academy! 

 Iâ€™m Alyanna Karlsson, 29 years old from Philippines and I am currently a resident in Sweden. I have degreen in Chemistry and Physics from Cebu Normal University class 2015 and since then I worked as a science teacher in Thailand. Since living in Sweden, I know that I want a career change and coding is the best option.

Iâ€™m interested in web development and did some attemps in self learning before and this year,2023, I have decided to study full-time at your academy or in other school, bootcamp, or academy. I keep getting lost and dont know exactly what to learn and what to focus. I moved in Sweden 2 years ago during the pandemic and learned the required Swedish Language course in only 6 months. For almost 2 years I did restaurant job to earn, but I know that I  want to become a developer because of the high demand of developers in Sweden and of course, the salary potential. Also, I think it is a fun career.

 Iâ€™m currently learning html, css, javascript via FreeCodeCamp  and  I did some c# coding in a 5 week course which is a requirement to apply for the free 2 year software development course in Sweden. When I saw the ad of your academy, I immediately applied and just took a chance.  A chance is all I need and I will not disappoint you. I just need a team to collaborate and a mentor to guide to learn faster and effectively. I am a kind of person who learns by doing and with collaborating with other.

I have resigned already at my restaurant job  to focus on self-studying web development( a decision I made even before I saw your ad), so I will be able to fully give my 100% to learn. 

I am looking forward for an interview, and by then hopefully I have finished the required knowledge for the Integrify Academy course from  FCC.

With kind regards,
Alyanna Karlsson
